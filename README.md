Behave.js - lightweight Functional Reactive Programming for Javascript
======================================================================

Behave.js provides a functional approach to reactive programming in 
Javascript, taking advantage of Javascript being an already-mutatey,
dynamically typed language (or, if you like, giving up all hope on
the great semantic work that has been done)

Documentation and clear testing is currently a TODO, but you can
check out the source (it is very short) or the one running
example:
